# my TODOs

this is just for notes and todo points

## fcn_vgg16

- test performance of fcn
- understand how skip connections work
- verify correct adaption from keras model, especially padding in conv layers
- train model/use pretrained weights from shelhammer et al. to make a demo

## crfrnn

- implement crfrnn layer in mxnet/gluon
- look up if implementation of permutohedral lattices exist

## next steps:

- combine models
- define data loader
- train model (at least with subset)


## next steps: emadl

- write sample network in EMADL
- sketch/write fcn_vgg16 in EMADL
- determine what functionalities might be missing in EMADL2GLUON
- sketch/write crfrnn layer in EMADL

## other notes:

- when rendering a mxnet model graph activate a conda env with graphviz installed
- /usr/bin/python doesn't seem to work
