# my TODOs

this is just for notes and todo points

## fcn_vgg16

- skip connections working correctly, model input is whacky for some reason
- fix input
- test performance of fcn
- understand how skip connections work

## crfrnn

- implement crfrnn layer in mxnet/gluon
- look up if implementation of permutohedral lattices exist


## next steps: emadl

- write sample network in EMADL
- sketch/write fcn_vgg16 in EMADL
- determine what functionalities might be missing in EMADL2GLUON
- sketch/write crfrnn layer in EMADL
